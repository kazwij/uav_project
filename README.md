## Project Introduction

The growing demand for small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in civil and military applications necessitates addressing challenges in propulsion system optimization. 
Designing efficient propellers for small UAVs involves navigating trade-offs in size, power, and weight against range and endurance requirements. This project aims to understand and overcome aerodynamic complexities unique to small UAVs, 
enhancing their overall performance and adaptability.

## Objective:

Develop a data-driven framework for enhancing the prediction of propeller performance, crucial for the evolving field of urban air mobility. Utilize modern research trends, 
incorporating both standalone and ensemble machine learning techniques to forecast thrust coefficient, power coefficient, and efficiency based on blade geometry and operational inputs.
